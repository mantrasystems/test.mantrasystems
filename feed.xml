MDR Annex XIV Part B describes Post-Market Clinical Follow-up as:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;general&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;a continuous process that proactively and continuously collects and evaluates clinical data on the use of a CE-marked medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the MDR states that PMCF should relate to the intended purpose of the device and have the aims of:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;confirming safety and performance throughout the expected lifetime of the device&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ensuring the continued acceptability of identified risks&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;detecting evidence of any emerging risks that were previously unknown&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to meet this diverse range of objectives, PMCF studies need to have a solid implementation strategy alongside a robust design. A key part of any PMCF implementation strategy must be a focus on ensuring high levels of data collection compliance, minimising gaps in datasets which could otherwise be held to be potential sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-methods-every-medical-device-manufacturer-should-know-to-improve-their-post-market-clinical-follow-up-studies&quot;&gt;5 methods every medical device manufacturer should know to improve their Post-Market Clinical Follow-up studies&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Promoting high levels of data entry compliance is a challenge in conducting any clinical investigation. Given that PMCF is intended to run throughout a device’s entire lifetime, devising ways of increasing and maintaining investigator engagement is central to long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are five methods for keeping investigators locked in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;1-simplicity&quot;&gt;1. Simplicity&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep it simple. Clinical investigations that try to collect too much data are cumbersome to work with. Investigators often have very limited time and are accommodating data entry around their other commitments, meaning that cumbersome studies cannot be consistently integrated into their working day. Keep it lean and focus only on the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;2-a-smooth-user-experience&quot;&gt;2. A smooth user experience&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Related to simplicity, choose your data entry system carefully. While most studies will now use an eCRF for data entry, not all interfaces are equally easy to work with. Ensure you work with a system that prioritises a smooth user experience and minimises the opportunity for frustration during data entry. It is also worth remembering that hospital-based IT systems may have limited power and are often part of a shared network, meaning that resource-heavy platforms may function poorly. It is also the case that data connectivity for handheld devices may be limited within certain clinical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;3-effective-communication&quot;&gt;3. Effective communication&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t leave investigators feeling as though they are operating in a vacuum. Keep in touch with them and ensure that heavy recruiters know that their efforts are appreciated. It’s also a great way to ensure that any “niggling” problems are resolved immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;4-reciprocal-benefit&quot;&gt;4. Reciprocal benefit&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PMCF studies have obvious benefits for manufacturers, helping to maintain regulatory approval of their devices and collecting crucial evidence on device safety and performance. Effectively encouraging investigator compliance calls for a PMCF study that also offers benefits for the healthcare professional. Opportunities for publications, podium presentations, and participation in investigator meetings all help, along with facilitating use of the data for internal clinical audits and performance reviews and a fair remuneration structure. At the outset of study design, consult with prospective clinical investigators and gain a deep understanding of what most benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;5-review-change-and-update&quot;&gt;5. Review, change and update&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take the time to ensure that the study design is working effectively. Make changes in line with investigator feedback and let them know that their comments and ideas have been implemented. Reacting to investigator feedback not only makes them feel valued; it also helps ensure that the study is best aligned to the needs of those who use your devices in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Post-Market Clinical Follow-up is most effective when powered by comprehensive and complete datasets. Using the tips in this article will give your PMCF studies the best chance of meeting these objectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is a vital component of any successful MDR compliance strategy.

        &lt;p&gt;The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) comes into force in May 2021 and replaces the existing Medical Device Directive (MDD). The MDR is 100 pages longer and has a much broader scope than the MDD, providing many challenges in achieving compliance. Companies with existing or new products must fully comply with the MDR however, for many, understanding the MDR in detail is quite a headache!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this podcast hosted by Kaizen Life Sciences as part of their “Life Sciences Leaders” podcast series, Paul (Mantra Systems CEO) discusses the MDR and how companies in the life sciences sector can break down the MDR into more manageable action steps.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it’s generating, searching, reviewing, appraising, interpreting or reporting clinical data, medical evidence is at the heart of MDR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, in the absence of a medical or scientific background, working with clinical evidence isn’t easy. With the increased complexities of the new EU MDR, medical device manufacturers need easy access to skilled professionals who are comfortable working with and generating clinical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical doctors are increasingly recognised as being perfectly positioned to meet this requirement. Doctors are trained to work with clinical evidence from the early stages of their career. Furthermore, in many cases they have worked as clinical investigators on medical studies, meaning that they are better qualified to drive compliance with clinical investigation data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Medical doctors also have a thorough understanding of the conditions that medical devices address, and have general clinical training that enables them to put diseases and interventions into context. In turn, this means that doctors are able to advise on pertinent data-points that can extract maximum value from Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) and other performance monitoring studies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of working with medical doctors for MDR compliance is that doctors are professionally trained to perform objective assessments of clinical information, resisting sources of bias. This professional objectivity is of huge value in meeting MDR requirements for performing clinical evaluation of medical devices. Engaging a suitably-trained medical doctor from outside your organisation demonstrates a commitment to regulatory objectivity that will be favourably viewed by Notified Bodies and other regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Doctors are also of value when trying to address any gaps in a medical device’s clinical evidence portfolio. An expertly-performed systematic literature review helps ensure that no relevant data is overlooked, and can also help to minimise expenditure on clinical investigations to generate new clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In summary, doctors have much to offer in helping medical device companies meet MDR requirements. Whether you are looking to &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/pmcf-study-design&quot;&gt;design PMCF studies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evaluation-services&quot;&gt;perform Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, engaging a medical doctor can be hugely advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Unless you have spent time working with medical device legislation in the past, the idea that software could be a medical device may be rather unexpected — a medical device is perhaps more traditionally viewed as a hardware product. Nonetheless, it is the case. Software is increasingly capable of medical functions such as making or assisting diagnosis, interpreting medical data, forming a prognosis, monitoring disease progression, and many others. It therefore makes sense to regulate software in line with physical medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745, fully implemented from May 2021, expands the definition of medical device and makes it even more likely that software will fall under its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Medical Device Regulation MDR 2017/745 represents the largest overhaul of medical device legislation in decades. The MDR introduces a wide range of changes including an extended definition of what constitutes a medical device. Following significant advances in the complexity and availability of software over the past decade, many types of medical software will fall within this extended definition and be subject to the full scope of the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So if you have a software product that performs a medical function, how can you determine if your software will be classed as a medical device? And what do you need to do to meet your obligations under the MDR?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;is-my-software-a-medical-device&quot;&gt;Is my software a medical device?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all software associated with the provision of healthcare will be classified as a medical device. Medical device legislation is intended to apply only to software whose expected purpose is in line with the definition of “medical device” provided in Article 2 of the MDR. However, because medical software performs such a vast array of purposes across healthcare, working with the Article 2 definition can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understanding whether or not the MDR will apply to a product is a key first step in developing a product compliance strategy beyond May 2021. In this article we set out some basic principles that may help developers understand whether the MDR applies to their products.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First of all, software must have a &lt;strong&gt;medical purpose on its own&lt;/strong&gt; in order to be classified as a medical device. This is important to consider with respect to ‘stand-alone’ software such as a diagnostic app, but even more important when software is an integral part of, or associated with, a hardware device. Determining whether or not software has a medical purpose depends partly upon the &lt;strong&gt;intended purpose specified by the manufacturer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is important to consider &lt;strong&gt;the extent to which medical value is added&lt;/strong&gt; to data entered into the software. For example, simple archive and retrieval software that stores serial blood sugar values without manipulating the data does not add real medical value and would not normally be classed as a medical device; whereas, if that same software highlighted worrying trends in the data and advised when a hospital visit may be needed, this is likely to be held as medical value and class the software as a medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Direct autonomous medical actions performed by software are another factor that will draw a software product under the definition of a medical device. For example, an app that analyses skin rashes to make a diagnosis would clearly be classed as a medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of understanding whether or not an individual software product may be subject to the MDR’s rules, it may be helpful to consider several categories of function and purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Basic support/admin software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Simple archive and retrieval&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Archive, retrieval and modify&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Data interpretation, advice and/or call-to-action&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Independent ‘smart’ diagnosis/prognosis/analysis&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mixed purpose/modular software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Combined hardware/software&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Closed loop products&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Contraceptive support&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-needs-to-be-done-if-software-is-a-medical-device&quot;&gt;What needs to be done if software is a medical device?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If a software product is classified as a medical device, then the full range of provisions in the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (“The MDR”) will apply to the product. This will mean implementing a number of systems that may be unfamiliar to software companies, including:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;developing a Quality Management System&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;implementing a Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) system to monitor performance of the product&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;designing Post-market Clinical Follow-up and Vigilance systems as components of PMS&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;performing a Clinical Evaluation of the product and submitting a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It will also be necessary to understand how to work with MDR Annex VIII to determine risk classification for the product, as well as learning how to use MDR Annex I that lists General Safety and Performance Requirements that must be adhered to for every product.&lt;/p&gt;

More than ever before, the MDR requires manufacturers to have a detailed understanding of how to produce high-quality clinical evidence to support their products.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite this, access to medical expertise remains limited across the medical device industry. This is unfortunate not only because medical experts have so much to contribute to the structural design of clinical studies. It is also a problem because medical professionals are better placed than anyone to understand how a clinical investigation would function in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Great clinical investigations combine two crucial elements:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;a robust design that ensures the production of quality data that is free from bias and adequately addresses the hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;an ability to be seamlessly implemented in practice&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Much has been said about robust study design with perhaps too little focus on how effectively investigations can be implemented in practice. A theoretically sound study design means nothing if clinical investigators are unable or unwilling to engage with it. Incomplete investigator compliance with data entry requirements will almost certainly lead to problematic gaps in data collection that compromise the integrity of the entire investigation. It also leads to missed deadlines as patient recruitment falls behind, with an associated increase in study costs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When modern medical device design focuses so strongly on human factors and ethnographic research that examine how effectively a device meets the demands of its users, why isn’t the same approach taken with clinical trials?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being a clinical investigator is not easy. Investigators are often busy clinicians who are managing multiple competing priorities. It is the job of the investigation design team to take measures to aid investigators in entering data and working with the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Methods that can facilitate investigator compliance include:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimising datapoints.&lt;/strong&gt; Collect only the information that is absolutely necessary to address the study hypothesis and/or objectives&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an electronic CRF.&lt;/strong&gt; Using a digital rather than paper-based data entry process means that data can be entered from anywhere (including smartphone and tablet), reducing disruption to investigator workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a fair remuneration structure.&lt;/strong&gt; While always ensuring that the principles of healthcare compliance are adhered to, fairly remunerating investigators for time and effort expended while working on the trial is an effective way to encourage engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate the trial into standard care.&lt;/strong&gt; Levels of investigator compliance are likely to be far higher if engagement with the trial causes no, or minimal, disruption to standard clinical activities.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Good clinical investigation design requires a combination of scientific and medical expertise. Working with healthcare professionals who have direct experience as clinical investigators is the best way to ensure that your trials are optimally designed for maximum investigator engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

Manufacturers, regulators, and product users are being asked to do more with fewer resources, meaning that processes must be streamlined in order to meet demands.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One step that has been considered is a partial relaxation of regulatory obligations to enable more products to be brought to market. The one-year delay to full implementation of the MDR arguably stands as evidence that regulators understand the difficulties that manufacturers are currently facing. Other proposed measures include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/afmps-issues-circular-allowing-68833/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;allowing re-use of single use devices to ensure ongoing availability of critical products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the event of a global health crisis, the Medical Device Regulations MDR 2017/745 allows for a partial step down from full regulatory enforcement. MDR Article 59 describes a procedure for emergency derogation from standard conformity assessment processes in the event of a public health emergency. Article 59 enables Competent Authorities to allow normal conformity assessment procedures to be bypassed for devices that are deemed essential in responding to the healthcare emergency. Unsurprisingly, in the context of the current crisis, Article 59 applications to the MHRA have been very numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it is a priority to ensure that life saving products are made available to staff and patients as quickly as possible, it is also vital that the safety and performance of medical devices is subject to the appropriate level of scrutiny. A balance must be found and the industry must ensure safety as well as product availability. The medical device market is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the world for good reason — unsafe or ineffective medical devices could cause far more problems than they solve.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We believe that conformity derogation procedures have an important role to play in securing device availability at times of crisis. However, we also believe that they should very much be the exception and that normal medical device regulatory processes should continue to be the default position. Product safety should take priority given the vast range of devices already available on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understandably, all medical device manufacturers are keen to reduce time and money spent on regulatory processes. However, the best approach is to work with a regulatory professional who will advise on the most efficient route to medical device certification. Working with a services provider who is an MDR expert will ensure than your devices are made available quickly, and that their regulatory approval status is protected well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The EU’s MDR implementation date was set for 26th May 2021. However in light of this coronavirus pandemic and with an urgent need for medical device manufacturers to help supply much needed equipment to resource-stretched hospitals, a proposal crafted by the European Commission recieved an approval — 693 votes in favour, 1 against, and 2 abstentions — to push back the implementation date.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This delay will be welcomed by some companies that were not ready for the switch-over, and it offers more time to take stock, zoom out and re-assess their regulatory strategy. We offered &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/eu-regulators-may-delay-mdr-enforcement&quot;&gt;5 tips to make best use of more time&lt;/a&gt; that might help in such a re-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A vote in the European Parliament has decisively approved a delay to full implementation of the EU’s MDR by one year, allowing the medical device industry to prioritise its Covid-19 response efforts.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Eu Regulators May Delay Mdr Enforcement</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/articles/eu-regulators-may-delay-mdr-enforcement" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eu Regulators May Delay Mdr Enforcement" /><published>2020-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-19T17:07:30+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/articles/eu-regulators-may-delay-mdr-enforcement</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/articles/eu-regulators-may-delay-mdr-enforcement">&lt;p&gt;It has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/europe/medical-device-manufacturers-face-challenges-preparing-stringent-new-eu-regulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;extensively documented&lt;/a&gt; that much of the medical device sector was facing challenges in being ready to meet the 26th May 2021 MDR implementation date. Sweeping regulatory changes and a lack of notified body capacity meant that many providers felt ill-prepared even before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factor in the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak and it should be no surprise that many were calling upon regulators to delay full implementation of the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medtechdive.com/news/coronavirus-eu-mdr-commission-proposal-1-year-delay/574842/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reports now suggest&lt;/a&gt; that these calls may be answered.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While this would be welcome news for many, what would a delay mean in practice? To what extent can preparations for EU MDR be put on ice?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although it is sensible in the short-term to focus on dealing with the exceptional pressures caused by the coronavirus outbreak, we believe that the importance of preparing for MDR enforcement must not be entirely displaced. This possible delay calls for a new wave of focus, using the extra time productively to gain broader advantages from being ready for the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Up until now, many companies across the industry were trying to do “just enough” to scrape through the 26th May deadline, viewing the MDR as a challenge rather than an opportunity. Our view all along has been that, with the correct approach, the EU MDR presents a unique opportunity for exceptional companies to prove the worth of their products and their wider organisation. Any implementation delay simply magnifies that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wisely investing the extra time to re-evaluate and partly re-purpose your existing MDR transition strategy could yield opportunities to make better use of clinical data, build relationships with clinical sites, and find solutions to compliance challenges that can better serve the needs of your wider organisation. With the correct strategy, regulatory departments have the opportunity to spearhead the development of new publications and to safeguard the competitive position of the company against competitors who have taken their eye off the MDR ball.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So what specifically can be done to make best use of an extra year? Here are 5 tips:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance your understanding of the MDR as an instrument.&lt;/strong&gt; At 175 pages, the MDR is a challenging instrument to work with. Very few in the industry would profess to have a thorough understanding of the legislation itself, yet it holds all the answers to ensuring MDR compliance of your products both now and in the future. &lt;a href=&quot;/mdr-resources/downloads/&quot;&gt;Download our white paper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/mdr-academy/events/live-seminars/&quot;&gt;register for one of our live seminars&lt;/a&gt; to learn everything you need to know about the MDR.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform a Gap Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Go back to basics and use Annex I MDR to re-evaluate how robustly your existing clinical data portfolio demonstrates conformity with the general safety and performance requirements that are relevant to your products. Engage with our team of specially trained medical professionals to bring an expert medical opinion to your Gap Analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-visit your PMCF plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever your existing strategy for generating PMCF data, &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/pmcf-study-design&quot;&gt;a well-designed medical device registry&lt;/a&gt; offers a host of advantages in data robustness, minimising bias, ensuring data continuity and building relationships with clinical sites.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take stock of your technical documentation.&lt;/strong&gt; Use the time to conduct an audit of your technical documents and compare your portfolio with the requirements in Annexes II and III of the MDR. &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt; for help in updating your documents to the required standard.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a CER, even if not yet due.&lt;/strong&gt; Compiling a CER to the requirements of the MDR rather than the MDD is a fantastic way to uncover any gaps in your Clinical Evaluation. It’s about much more than just the document — identifying any areas of deficiency now leaves plenty of time to address them before the revised MDR implementation date. Our medical specialists are experts at writing CERs and performing Clinical Evaluation of medical devices.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The likely delay to full MDR implementation is a great opportunity to take stock, zoom out and re-assess your regulatory strategy. A sensible investment of time now will ensure you are well ahead of the competition when the MDR does come into full force. This is much more than just a box-ticking exercise — done properly, it helps ensure that your devices can continue to be where they are needed most — in the hands of your customers, providing better and safer healthcare for patients everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Not quite, but the regulators might have pruned the trees a little.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It has been extensively documented that much of the medical device sector was facing challenges in being ready to meet the 26th May 2021 MDR implementation date.

        &lt;p&gt;From this date, the MDR will be in full effect and EU-based medical device manufacturers will be required to provide updated technical documentation to meet the standards of the new legislative framework.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Across the industry, medical device companies are facing challenges in meeting the demands of the new legislative framework. Long-held claims of equivalence are no longer valid and the need to evidence every indication is placing huge demands on evidence-generation systems that are difficult to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-has-the-medical-device-directive-mdd-been-replaced&quot;&gt;Why has the Medical Device Directive (MDD) been replaced?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although generally robust and relatively permissive of innovation, the MDD was considered to have numerous flaws in enforcing medical device safety, reliability and general product quality, exposed by notorious incidents such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/metal-metal-hip-implants/concerns-about-metal-metal-hip-implants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the metal-on-metal hip scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Legislators were compelled to implement reform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The new MDR attempts to reduce the likelihood of future incidents of this nature by tightening the requirements for proving safety and effectiveness of all medical devices, regardless of how long the product has been on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-will-the-industry-be-affected&quot;&gt;How will the industry be affected?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From an industry perspective, the most important changes are the need to provide evidence &lt;i&gt;“on an ongoing basis”&lt;/i&gt; to support every individual indication, in parallel with the reduced capacity to claim equivalence to devices already approved for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These changes mean that manufacturers across the industry face &lt;b&gt;a significantly increased evidence-generation burden&lt;/b&gt;, meaning a potentially huge increase in cost to meet the demands for medical device compliance. In some cases, this may even challenge the commercial viability of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mantra Systems is the answer to this dilemma. We are experts at navigating the evidence-generation requirements of MDR and will ensure that you have the systems in place to meet the demands of the new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Obtaining a medical device CE-mark under MDR requires robust clinical evidence in the form of Real World Evidence (RWE), built from real world data (RWD). Generating RWE is difficult and resource-intensive. Our experienced specialists will work with you to design and  develop your &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/pmcf-study-design&quot;&gt;RWE generation system&lt;/a&gt; to the highest level of legal and regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

At Mantra Systems our objective is to make sure that our clients choose the method of real-world data harvesting that is right for them. This article outlines some of the different methods available for collecting real-world data and producing RWE.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The choice of real-world data collection method is often driven by a combination of factors. Some of the factors to consider include:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;market sector&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;availability of external data sources&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;product type&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;available company resources&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;time and criticality&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the method chosen by medical device manufacturers often isn’t the best one for their needs. A poor choice of RWE generation method tends to lead to an accumulation of problems over time, as weaknesses of either collection method or the data itself tend to compound as data collection is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers may also find that compliance of data collection by investigators is far below requirements if insufficient attention is given to the choice of data collection method. Ultimately, the wrong choice leads to both time and money being wasted and leaves a critical problem remaining to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;differing-market-sectors&quot;&gt;Differing market sectors&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some market sectors are extremely fortunate in this regard as there are already a number of external or nationalised registries that collect data on the performance of multiple products within a sector. For example, the National Joint Registry in the UK collects real-world data on the performance of joint replacement implants. This is a rich source of data that companies can access to compile evidence for regulatory submission, and has the advantage of being consecutive, non-selective, and objective (ie administered by an external agent rather than the manufacturer of the product in question).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Other market sectors are not so fortunate. In the absence of such nationalised registries, manufacturers must find other ways to generate RWE.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For some products, a simple patient survey may suffice, perhaps collecting outcome measures such as EQ-5D-5L or pain VAS in return for a modest reward. This will suffice for lower risk devices where the level of scrutiny of RWE is comparatively light. The priority is to collect incidences of Adverse Events and, ideally, some limited functional outcomes data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;common-problems&quot;&gt;Common problems&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For products in higher risk categories (Class IIb and III under the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Medical Device Regulation&quot;&gt;MDR&lt;/abbr&gt;), a more robust system of real-world data collection will be required.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In some cases it may be possible to buy data from a commercial external database administered by a data provider. This has the advantage of avoiding the need to build a new data collection system &lt;i&gt;“from scratch”&lt;/i&gt;, however there are numerous disadvantages to this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Firstly, the manufacturer will have no control over which data points are collected, meaning that they have no ability to tailor the data collected to the needs of either themselves or their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Secondly, the manufacturer has no control over HOW the data was collected — in the era of GDPR and other important data control measures, the manufacturer will need to provide justification for the data collection methods employed in generating their RWE.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the data remains owned by the data provider, meaning there is no opportunity to make multiple uses of the same data at different times without paying repeatedly to extend licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, such data is almost always retrospective. Regulators increasingly require prospective data to support regulatory submissions, and the inherent inflexibility of retrospective datasets may often mean that manufacturers need to seek alternative or ancillary data to maintain regulatory approval over time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-solution&quot;&gt;A solution&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For these reasons and many others, a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/pmcf-study-design&quot;&gt;medical device registry&lt;/a&gt; offers numerous advantages. One particular advantage of a dedicated product registry is the ability to record data in real-time. In an increasingly digital world, this is a huge advantage of such a data collection system. Dedicated product registries are also prospective.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/pmcf-study-design&quot;&gt;Our dedicated registry building service&lt;/a&gt; will ensure that you have the most robust, adaptable, personalised and appropriate Real World Evidence generation system for your individual requirements.
