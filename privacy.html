We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Will your information be shared with anyone?</h2>

                <li><b>Legal Obligations:</b> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
                <li><b>Vital Interests:</b> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

              <h2 id="cookies" class="target">Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> We don't use cookies, but we do use tracking technologies to anonymously collect your browsing information and use it in a way that complies with GDPR. We don't share this data with any third parties.</p>
              <h2>Do we use anti-spam controls on forms?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> We use an unobtrusive hidden input to trick spammers in order to filter out their submissions.</p>
              <h2>How long do we keep your information?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>
              <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary, unless a shorter retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).</p>
              <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
              <h2>How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>
              <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
              <h2>Do we collect information from minors?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
              <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependant's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
              <h2>What are your privacy rights?</h2>
              <p><b>In short:</b> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
              <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right to complain</a> to your local data protection supervisory authority.</p>
              <h2>Data breach</h2>
              <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorised access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Mantra Systems Ltd believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Mantra Systems Ltd becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorised access, use or disclosure of personal information Mantra Systems Ltd will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
