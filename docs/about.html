                <div class="answer">
                  <p>At its core, working with the MDR is about working with clinical evidence. Whether you need to <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evidence-generation">generate clinical evidence for PMCF</a>, <a href="/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evaluation">analyse data for writing a CER</a>, or <a href="/eu-mdr-compliance/software-as-a-medical-device-samd">get your software application MDR-ready</a>, our medical experts have the clinical acumen to ensure that your clinical evidence is produced and interpreted with the highest levels of professionalism. Medical professionals work with clinical evidence all day. We bring their specialist capabilities directly to your MDR strategy.</p>

                  <p>We believe in transparency and aim to build long-term relationships with our clients. This commitment is demonstrated by our customer-focused pricing strategy. You pay a small deposit upfront, only paying the balance when the work has been completed to your total satisfaction.

                </h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>Yes. Our unique business model allows us to scale to accommodate almost any amount of work. Many of our medical professionals remain clinically active, meaning that we have trained more than we presently need. This system allows us to have ready availability of redundant capacity that can be called upon in the event of a surge in demand. Whatever your requirements, our unique business model allows us to step in faster than any of our competitors.</p>

                  <p>No. We will work with you to produce systems and to support your EU MDR compliance, but we do not conduct research ourselves.
