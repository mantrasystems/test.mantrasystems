                <div class="answer">
                  <p>After completing the Foundation Training, if you submit your post-course exercise to an excellent standard, you will be invited to undertake paid work as a team member in medical writing projects through the Mantra Systems Associates Program. You would become a member of an international group of doctors who undertake freelance work in your spare time with us. Initially, this will involve conducting Systematic Literature Reviews contributing towards production of Clinical Evaluation Reports coordinated by a lead writer. Work will be offered to you based on quality of your post-course work, experience, and alignment with your clinical field of expertise.</p>

                  <p>No - you will be offered work on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and you are always free to say yes or no. Only once you formally agree to a work block will you be under any obligation. The whole program is designed to work around your existing clinical commitments and you must not feel under any pressure to change your work pattern to accommodate it.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>The amount of work offered will vary according to several parameters. The medical device market typically slows down in August and December and is busiest in January - April and in September; therefore, the concentration of work available will correlate with this pattern. We also offer work to Associates based on the quality of previous work or, in the case of those that are new, the quality of their post-course exercise. Those factors said, we currently offer a regular stream of work to our active Associates and, if they are 'in the market' for a project, they are generally not without a project to work on. Our most active Associates are offered around 5-10 projects in a year.</p>

                </h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>Time taken per project will vary according to project complexity, with more complex (and time-consuming) projects being better remunerated. It also varies a lot between individuals. However, a general rule would be <b>10 - 20 hours per project with typically a 4-week timeframe</b> in which to complete the work. It's very much designed to be "do-able" around an existing clinical career.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>Remuneration will be according to a fee agreed in advance of each work package. The fee will reflect (amongst other factors) the complexity of the medical device, the complexity and depth of work involved, and expected time to perform. The following guidelines are indicative only and are intended simply to highlight the likely range of payments&colon; <b>Literature Review work:</b> &pound;1,600 - &pound;3,500 per project. <b>CER Writing work:</b> &pound;3,000 - &pound;5,000 per project.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>Completion of later levels, along with experience working on projects as a team member, will enable you to act as lead medical writer yourself, offering greater responsibility, exposure and pay.

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>The skills you will learn are highly relevant to broader opportunities across the industry. Completion of Level 1 will enable you to work as a freelance medical writer, for example. Completion of later levels will broaden your freelance scope and will be highly attractive to recruiters into Medical Affairs positions and other roles within the industry. You will be at a huge advantage over other candidates who do not have the same training and experience.</p>
