        &lt;p&gt;However, due to delays in processing applications and introducing the new medical device regulatory framework, the MHRA have just announced that they will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementation-of-the-future-regulation-of-medical-devices-and-extension-of-standstill-period/implementation-of-the-future-regulations&quot;&gt;extending the UKCA implementation deadline to July 2024&lt;/a&gt;. This comes as a welcome relief to medical device manufacturers, who now have more time to ensure that they are adequately prepared for this transition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The availability of more time is not a reason to put UKCA to the back of collective minds however. Rather, it’s an opportunity to take stock and ensure that a UKCA strategy is properly developed and implemented well before the new deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we review updated requirements for UKCA marking and what they mean for manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-ukca-mark&quot;&gt;What is a UKCA mark?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Following Great Britain’s exit from the EU single market in December 2020, CE (Conformité Européenne) marking was to be replaced by the UKCA mark for medical devices marketed in the territory. The UKCA mark is a mandatory mark on a product which indicates that it conforms to the new GB legislation and operates in much the same way as a CE mark in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer or, if mandated, their authorised representative is responsible for affixing a UKCA mark to the product, assuming they are authorised to do so following a conformity process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;where-will-it-apply&quot;&gt;Where will it apply?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The UKCA mark only applies in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). CE marking will continue in Northern Ireland (NI) as it remains aligned with the EU single market for goods. Products that will be placed on the market in both GB and NI will therefore need both UKCA and CE marking unless they are “Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods”, in which case they can be sold in GB with a CE mark and do not need a UKCA mark.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;are-there-any-differences-between-ukca-and-ce-marking&quot;&gt;Are there any differences between UKCA and CE marking?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As of today, two different legal frameworks exist to obtain UKCA/CE marking for a product, dependent on whether it is marketed in the UK or the EU, respectively. In the UK, the regulations are based on the old Medical Device Directive (MDD), implemented into domestic law by the UK Medical Device Regulations 2002 (UK MDR 2002). Prior to the end of the transition period, this gave effect in UK law to the following Directives:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01990L0385-20071011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Directive 90/385/EEC&lt;/a&gt; on active implantable medical devices (EU AIMDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01993L0042-20071011&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Directive 93/42/EEC&lt;/a&gt; on medical devices (EU MDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:01998L0079-20120111&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Directive 98/79/EC&lt;/a&gt; on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (EU IVDD)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because the Brexit transition period ended before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02017R0745-20170505&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;European Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745&lt;/a&gt; came into effect, the European MDR has not been adopted in the UK, unlike in Europe where it is now mandatory to comply with MDR 2017/745 to obtain a medical device CE mark. This means that the Great Britain route to market and UKCA marking requirements are still officially based on the requirements in the MDD.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moving forwards, this means in principle that companies will need two parallel frameworks to be able to market products in both the UK and EU, hence the need for a transition period. The extended transition period outlined by the MHRA will hopefully lessen the burden of becoming compliant with both systems.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;can-a-product-have-both-ukca-and-ce-marks&quot;&gt;Can a product have both UKCA and CE marks?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Providing a product fulfils the necessary requirements, it may carry both a UKCA and CE mark. The presence of multiple conformity marks is common on internationally sold products.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-uk-legislation-needs-to-be-followed&quot;&gt;What UK legislation needs to be followed?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The UK government has issued several Statutory Instruments to amend current legislation, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/696/contents/made&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019&lt;/a&gt; and has now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-future-regulation-of-medical-devices-in-the-united-kingdom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;concluded consultation on the UK MDR 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The specific details of the new UK medical device framework are yet to be published following the UK government consultation on the proposed changes, which started in 2021. However, the government response in June 2022 highlighted that the new GB medical device regulations will be closely aligned with the 2017 EU Medical Device Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;when-will-ukca-marking-come-into-force&quot;&gt;When will UKCA marking come into force?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As previously stated, UKCA marking was due to be enforced from July 2023, in-line with the UK Medical Device Regulations 2022 (UK MDR 2022). However, due to understandable delays with regard to publishing the new regulatory framework and the backlog of applications submitted to notified bodies, the MHRA issued a statement on 21st October 2022 indicating that this will be delayed until July 2024. Since this has not yet been confirmed by law, further updates are expected from the MHRA and will be announced via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementation-of-the-future-regulation-of-medical-devices-and-extension-of-standstill-period&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MHRA website&lt;/a&gt; in the near future. The UK MDR 2022 will also be updated to reflect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is important to highlight that current and valid CE marks will continue to be accepted in Great Britain until this time point. New legislation on medical device regulation highlighting the transitional arrangements is due to be released by the government in Spring 2023. This will also include new Post-Market Surveillance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers will be able to continue to place CE marked devices on the GB market after 1 July 2023. From July 2024, the transitional arrangements will apply for CE and UKCA marked devices placed on the GB market. Where third party conformity assessment is required, a UK Approved Body is needed. However, manufacturers of non-sterile and non-measuring Class I devices and general IVDs can self-certify against the UKCA marking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The government’s June 2022 response has indicated that there will be generous transitional periods in the new medical device framework. These arrangements would allow products to be placed on the market as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;General medical devices&lt;/b&gt; - until either the certificate expires or for three years after the new regulations take effect (whichever occurred sooner) and&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-vitro Diagnostics (IVDs)&lt;/b&gt; - until either the certificate expires or five years after the new regulations take effect (whichever is sooner)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Transitional provisions would not apply if there were significant changes in the design or intended purpose of the device. Furthermore, all products that will benefit from transitional arrangements will need to comply with post-market requirements. The below schematic illustrates the updated timeline for UKCA marking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;updated-ukca-timline&quot;&gt;Updated UKCA timline&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;UKCA marking comes into force.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Medical devices &amp;amp; IVD devices can be either CE or UKCA marked (or both).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Deadline for medical device &amp;amp; IVD device manufacturers to replace existing CE marks with UKCA mark.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content bg-b0 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1st July 2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UKCA mark will be mandatory for all medical devices &amp;amp; IVD devices on the GB market. CE marking will not be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;small-text align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Current timeline in-line with the MHRA update on 21st October 2022 (maybe subject to change)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-needs-immediate-action&quot;&gt;What needs immediate action?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To ensure that manufacturers are prepared for a smooth transition, in-line with the new timescales for UKCA marking, the following are key requirements for placing a device on the GB market:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;All medical devices, including in-vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs), custom-made devices and systems or procedure packs, need to be registered with the MHRA before they are placed on the Great Britain market&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If you are a medical device manufacturer based outside the UK and wish to place a device on the GB market, you need to appoint a single &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/person-responsible-for-regulatory-compliance-prrc&quot;&gt;UK Responsible Person&lt;/a&gt; for all of your devices, who will act on your behalf to carry out specified tasks, such as registration.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;CE marking will continue to be recognised in Great Britain until 30 June 2024&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Certificates issued by &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;EU-recognised Notified Bodies&lt;/a&gt; will continue to be valid for the GB market until 30 June 2024&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The EU no longer recognises UK Notified Bodies&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;UK Notified Bodies are not able to issue CE certificates - and have become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approved-bodies-for-medical-devices&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UK Approved Bodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is – don’t panic! The delay in enforcing UKCA marking is a great opportunity to prepare and re-assess your regulatory strategy so that you are ahead of the game of other competitors in the field. Investing time to get things correct, in-line with new regulations will ensure that your medical devices can continue to be sold and used where they are required most, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation-report-cer&quot;&gt;CERs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation-plan-cep&quot;&gt;CEPs&lt;/a&gt; is a complex challenge that calls for extensive experience and a thorough understanding of the MDR, relevant guidelines and applicable standards. For this reason, many companies prefer to outsource to an expert rather than struggle internally and risk non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, with a broad and confusing range of support options available, how can you be sure you are choosing the best supplier for your needs? What factors should you consider when choosing a contractor for writing your CERs and CEPs?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve compiled a list of considerations that will help you make the right choice when choosing a medical writer for your CERs and CEPs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;1-fixed-and-fair-price&quot;&gt;1. Fixed and fair price&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sounds obvious - but do you actually know what you will need to pay? &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; is a complex and time-consuming process, so be wary of any offers that charge per unit time or that cap working time before extra charges kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, look for suppliers that will commit to a fixed price in advance with no hidden extras. This way, you’ll have control of your budget and won’t be at risk of the ‘sunken cost fallacy’.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, be wary of choosing on the basis of price alone - while it’s important, it shouldn’t be the only factor to be considered when making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;2-fixed-timeline&quot;&gt;2. Fixed timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Always look for a supplier that will commit to a specific completion date for the work, with regular check-ins throughout the process. This helps ensure that you stay well ahead of any submission deadlines and in full control.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A supplier that will readily commit to a deadline on paper is generally one that has your interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;3-do-they-have-the-right-credentials&quot;&gt;3. Do they have the right credentials?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s vital that those tasked with writing your CERs and CEPs are appropriately qualified to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What assurances can you get that your potential supplier will have suitable regulatory and subject matter expertise?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What level of experience do they have?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be wary of suppliers who are not open about the qualifications of their writers and reviewers; instead, look for those who provide tangible reasons why their writers will fulfil requirements for knowledge, experience and objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;4-do-they-claim-or-demonstrate-expertise&quot;&gt;4. Do they claim or demonstrate expertise?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s an important difference between the two. Plenty of suppliers claim to be experts without doing anything to back up these claims on a public forum. To what extent have they &lt;q&gt;“put themselves out there”&lt;/q&gt; and faced unfiltered questions from medical device manufacturers?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look for suppliers who have shown a readiness to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise, rather than simply claim it. Be sure to check out any videos or previous Q&amp;amp;A sessions they have run and pay close attention to how knowledgeable they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-how-good-is-their-communication&quot;&gt;5. How good is their communication?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A prospective supplier’s website, emails and marketing material are all great ‘try before you buy’ screening opportunities that reveal the standard of writing you can expect. Don’t risk entrusting complex technical writing to a supplier who makes basic errors in their own material.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, look for suppliers who adhere to the highest standards of written communication in all aspects of their business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;6-responsiveness&quot;&gt;6. Responsiveness&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How quickly do prospective suppliers get back to you after an enquiry?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Do they make you feel valued and important right from the outset, or are you left waiting while being told that ‘your enquiry is important’?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Is your enquiry handled personally by a named individual, or through a ‘boilerplate’ interface and a call centre?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clinical Evaluation done properly is a collaborative process that calls for effective and bilateral communication. Look for suppliers who build an instant rapport and put you in direct contact with members of the project team.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;7-dedicated-focus-or-bolt-on-service&quot;&gt;7. Dedicated focus or bolt-on service?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clinical Evaluation is not something that lends itself to non-specialists. For this reason, look for suppliers who focus specifically on CERs and CEPs rather than those who bury their Clinical Evaluation service amongst a multitude of others.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can’t expect a specialist, dedicated service from a non-specialist. If you can’t easily find details of a Clinical Evaluation service on a supplier’s website, it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;8-do-they-stand-by-their-work&quot;&gt;8. Do they stand by their work?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look for suppliers who will stand by the quality of their work and provide FREE ongoing support once the CER/CEP have been submitted to a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;Notified Body&lt;/a&gt;. After all, why would any company refuse to do this if they truly believed in the standard of their work?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choosing the right supplier is a key decision when outsourcing the writing of medical device CERs and CEPs. Making a selection based on price alone can be a costly mistake; instead, focus on the above criteria and make a choice based on proven factors that will directly impact the quality of work delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

Or are you a supplier who recently learned that your product is classified as a medical device under the new MDR? If your answer to either of these questions is ‘yes’, then this article is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to place a medical device on the market, you as a manufacturer have to demonstrate conformity with the MDR and compliance with the GSPRs laid out in Annex I, regardless of the device classification.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because most Class I devices don’t require the involvement of a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;Notified Body&lt;/a&gt;, it can be tempting to ‘do the minimum’ for Class I regulatory compliance. Under the MDR, however, this can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we will discuss how to achieve &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/&quot;&gt;MDR compliance&lt;/a&gt; specifically for Class I devices, with a focus on what to keep in mind while self-certifying.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;1-is-your-product-a-medical-device-under-mdr-article-2&quot;&gt;1. Is your product a medical device under MDR Article 2?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first step towards MDR compliance is confirming whether your product is a medical device. Whether your product satisfies the definition of a medical device depends in large part on the intended purpose, which you as a manufacturer control. Take great care in matching this against the definition in Article 2 of the MDR. Remember that non-standard items such as “reagents” and “software” can all meet the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;2-what-is-its-risk-classification&quot;&gt;2. What is its risk classification?&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1:&lt;/b&gt; How to work with Annex VIII from the MDR&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The next step is to identify the device’s risk classification. Risk classification in MDR reflects the potential risk of harm that a medical device poses. Medical devices under Class I are generally low risk devices which include non-invasive devices with non-critical functions, such as wound care devices, stethoscopes, tongue depressors, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The MDR uses a rule-based system to determine a medical device’s risk class. There are 22 rules outlined in Annex VIII of the MDR for classifying any medical device into its appropriate risk class. Work through it as described in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx55LZ3snM4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;How to work with Annex VIII of the MDR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;3-demonstrate-device-conformity&quot;&gt;3. Demonstrate device conformity&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A product can only be placed on the EU market if it satisfies all the applicable MDR requirements, which apply to Class I devices just the way they do to others. The main requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;i-meet-general-safety-and-performance-requirements-gsprs&quot;&gt;i) Meet General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a manufacturer, you are required to perform a relevancy analysis of the MDR Annex I GSPRs to work out which ones apply to your product. The best way to do this is to use a GSPR checklist or table to show which GSPRs apply. Following this, begin collating evidence to support conformity with those that are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-conduct-a-clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;ii) Conduct a Clinical Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-insert youtube-player&quot; data-id=&quot;cUu6YtEdO9c&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 2:&lt;/b&gt; See how our Clinical Evaluation Report writing service works from start to finish&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All devices, regardless of risk class, must undergo a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; in line with MDR Article 61 and Annex XIV Part A.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t underestimate the importance of Clinical Evaluation, even to Class I devices – even if you can self-certify, your &lt;b title=&quot;e.g. a Government&quot;&gt;Competent Authority&lt;/b&gt; still has the right to review your technical documents and will often plumb straight for the device’s  &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation-report-cer&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)&lt;/a&gt;. That said, a CER needn’t be as complex as for a Class III device – it’s all about balance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;Discuss Class I CERs&lt;/a&gt; with a member of our team if you are in any doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-prepare-technical-documentation&quot;&gt;iii) Prepare technical documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technical documentation should contain information on the device’s design, intended use, composition, basic UDI-DI, IFU, labelling, testing, materials, and so on, as required by MDR Article II.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It should also set out plans for PMS and other activities as per MDR Article III. A well organised technical documentation file is crucial in demonstrating your device’s compliance. Since most Class I devices are self-certified, manufacturers may overlook the importance of a detailed, well-structured, and clear medical device technical file.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even though it is self-certified, the manufacturer is required to make the technical documentation available to the Competent Authority, authorised representative (if applicable), and notified body (when applicable). So, it is essential to make sure that the documents are prepared in a clear, orderly, and unambiguous manner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you need help in putting together your technical document library, you may benefit from the range of document templates available through our &lt;a href=&quot;/enable-ce-mark/&quot;&gt;MDR Academy platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-involve-a-notified-body&quot;&gt;iv) Involve a Notified Body&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This step is not applicable for all Class I medical devices. But as a manufacturer, you must involve a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;Notified Body&lt;/a&gt; for Class I devices which are:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;sterile devices (Class Is)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;reusable surgical instruments (Class Ir)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;devices with a measuring function (Class Im)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;4-meet-the-general-obligations-for-manufacturers&quot;&gt;4. Meet the general obligations for manufacturers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/medical-device-manufacturers&quot;&gt;General obligations for manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; are outlined in the Article 10 of the MDR 2017/745. To meet these requirements, manufacturers must:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ensure that their medical devices are MDR-compliant in design and manufacture&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;have &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management&quot;&gt;Risk Management system&lt;/a&gt; in place&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;perform a thorough &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;keep a record of current technical documentation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;have access to a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/person-responsible-for-regulatory-compliance-prrc&quot;&gt;Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;have a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/quality-management-system-qms&quot;&gt;Quality Management System (QMS)&lt;/a&gt; in place&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-conduct-the-final-steps-before-placing-your-device-on-the-market&quot;&gt;5. Conduct the final steps before placing your device on the market&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you complete all the documents to demonstrate the device conformity and meet the manufacturer obligations under the MDR, you must file an EU Declaration of Conformity (DoC) which includes the information listed in Annex IV of the MDR. Don’t forget to include translations for all the countries in which the device will be made available. Once you have a DoC in hand, you can affix a CE mark to your device and register it for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;6-plan-ahead&quot;&gt;6. Plan ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once your device is on the market, it is your responsibility to have a &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms&quot;&gt;Post Market Surveillance (PMS) system&lt;/a&gt; in place. This is another area that is sometimes overlooked by manufacturers of Class I devices. Once again, the skill is in striking a balance to ensure that systems are comprehensive enough to detect vital information without being too onerous and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PMS should enable you to gather and assess safety and performance data to determine whether or not any actions are required. As a part of the PMS system, you must also:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;report all serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCA) to the appropriate Competent Authorities and execute all relevant investigations&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;take prompt action in case there is a reason to think that a device placed on the market or in service is not in compliance with the MDR&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The key message is — &lt;b&gt;don’t neglect the importance of a full MDR regulatory system for Class I devices&lt;/b&gt;. Neglecting key areas such as Clinical Evaluation and Post-Market Surveillance will just lead to trouble down the line. Taking advice before putting systems in place can help ensure that they are sufficiently robust without exceeding what is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also challenging to perform and is an aspect of Clinical Evaluation that can be a source of confusion, difficulty and non-conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we help to demystify the process of systematic review of literature for Clinical Evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-meddev-271-rev-4&quot;&gt;What is MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medical-device-regulation.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2_7_1_rev4_en.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4&lt;/a&gt; is one of a series of guidance documents published by the European Commission intended to assist &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/medical-device-manufacturers&quot;&gt;medical device manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;Notified Bodies&lt;/a&gt; in meeting medical device regulatory obligations. MedDev stands for MEDical DEVices documents. MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 is a detailed document which sets out comprehensive guidelines for medical device manufacturers and notified bodies for the conduct of Clinical Evaluation. MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 is a technical document which can be challenging to digest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix 5&lt;/strong&gt; of the MedDev guideline sets out requirements for the identification and review of literature in the context of Clinical Evaluation. It is therefore central to performing a compliant literature review.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-role-of-a-literature-review-in-medical-device-clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;What is the role of a literature review in medical device Clinical Evaluation?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The review of published literature is a critical component of medical device Clinical Evaluation. A literature review is performed to inform two major elements of a Clinical Evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A review of the current knowledge/ the state of the art – this enables the identification of safety and performance benchmarks against which performance of the subject (and, if relevant, equivalent) device may be evaluated&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A review of literature relating to the subject (and equivalent) device.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is a requirement that literature reviews are performed according to a documented protocol and that they include both favourable and unfavourable data. They must be representative and not be biased or selective; therefore, methods must be set out clearly for inclusion, exclusion, appraisal and analysis of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-guidance-is-offered-by-meddev-271-rev-4-appendix-5&quot;&gt;What guidance is offered by MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 Appendix 5?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appendix 5 of MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 provides a range of guidance for Clinical Evaluation literature reviews, including:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Offering general instructions on literature searching&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Outlining methods for constructing protocols for undertaking a literature review&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Defining the key elements of literature reviews that are required in order to deliver a compliant &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation-report-cer&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understanding the literature search and review process explained in &lt;strong&gt;Appendix 5&lt;/strong&gt; can be made easier by dividing it into four stages:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;general-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;information row tile info-process&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content bg-b2 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stage 1&lt;/span&gt; Background&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Search criteria&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Databases&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Inclusion &amp;amp; exclusion criteria&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content bg-b3 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stage 2&lt;/span&gt; Literature Screen&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Analysing abstracts&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Full article&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content bg-b4 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stage 3&lt;/span&gt; Appraisal &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Selection &amp;amp; Exclusion&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Critique &amp;amp; Appraise&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=&quot;col col-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content bg-b0 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stage 4&lt;/span&gt; Literature Report&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Benefits / Risk&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Report&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-1-background-to-the-literature-search&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Background to the literature search&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Background to the literature search stage sets the scene for the substantive literature search, review, appraisal and report to follow. Performed properly, a rationale for performing the literature review should be clearly documented.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The background to the literature search should include information such as:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Name of the device/model.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Importance of literature review in the risk management process. The review should provide data on current therapies, diagnostic measures, and measures for the management of medical conditions for the targeted patient population. This will help in order to assess the acceptable benefits/risks.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Outcomes of previous literature reviews and literature searches conducted by manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Identification of any equivalent or benchmark devices to be included in the evaluation, including the name and model of these devices.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carefully formulated research question(s) should be set out to guide the selection of search terms. Selected search terms will then be subjected to an objective, non-biased, systematic search and review. The inputs required for this section are the device description and the expected device performance; these can be applied for the formation of relevant research questions. Methods or protocols adopted for the conduct of literature review should set out the search methodology, sources of data, selection &amp;amp; exclusion criteria and appraisal/critique methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-2-literature-screen&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Literature Screen&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The next step is to screen initial results for relevance to the research questions. This stage can be thought of as a ‘triage’ of sources, with the objective being to limit full appraisal to only those results that are pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 requires the use of carefully formulated inclusion / exclusion criteria, augmented by an objective, non-biased, systematic screening and review process such as PICO (patient characteristics, type of intervention, control, and outcome queries), or PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Whatever method is used, it should align with the method specified in the search protocol (or review protocol) developed prior to commencing the review.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a practical sense, begin by reviewing the titles and abstracts – the full text is not required at this stage. Due to the number of results often found by search terms, screening needs to be efficient while maintaining appropriate scrutiny. It may be helpful to use exclusion codes to codify reasons for exclusions (which may include, for example, “unrelated topic” or “article not available in English” etc).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember&lt;/b&gt; — this stage is all about identifying relevant sources.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-3-appraisal--analysis&quot;&gt;Stage 3: Appraisal &amp;amp; Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before considering how to perform appraisal and analysis, it’s important to understand the difference between them:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appraisal&lt;/b&gt; means to assess the quality of a source, methodological quality, scientific validity, reliability, relevance and weighting to the evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt; is the post-appraisal stage of evaluating what the results mean (or what they tell us). Appraisal and weighting should be considered during analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4, an appraisal plan should form part of the search protocol. It is advisable to create an appraisal framework covering multiple domains (such as relevance, clinical significance, study type, etc) and it can be useful to assign a code to each appraisal element. As part of appraisal, a score can be applied against each appraisal domain, forming a structured and codified appraisal summary of each source and the ‘body’ of sources as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Weighting is a key concept in appraisal that’s worth considering independently. The weighting of a source indicates how much importance should be placed on the results of that source when compared to others. A high weighting indicates that the results should be deemed more relevant to the evaluation than data from a lower weighting source.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Following appraisal, the next stage is to analyse the data. The analysis will depend on the reason for conducting the literature review; in a clinical evaluation, the appraisal may consider (for example):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Does the data demonstrate that the device is suitable for its intended purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Does the data demonstrate compliance with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs)?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;During appraisal, ensure that an objective approach is taken and that both favourable and unfavourable data is treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-4-literature-review-report&quot;&gt;Stage 4: Literature Review Report&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The fourth and final stage of the literature analysis and review process is preparing a literature review report. While writing the report, especially if performed in the context of a clinical evaluation, it is important to identify quantifiable safety and performance parameters, whether in relation to the subject device or comparable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure the report includes enough information for a reviewer to understand how the search was conducted and what appraisal and analysis criteria were used. Present a summary of each source (outlining a rationale for the appraisal and weighting) in the body of the document and outline the analysis towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Performing a Systematic Literature Review to the required standard is not easy. While the framework in Appendix 5 of MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 is not without its limitations, it is useful as a starting point and in ensuring that the review has an appropriate structure without major omissions.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, if you work on &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation-report-cer&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation Reports (CERs)&lt;/a&gt;, you are probably starting to realise how crucial &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/systematic-literature-reviews&quot;&gt;Systematic Literature Reviews&lt;/a&gt; are in achieving regulatory compliance under the new MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The importance of critical appraisal of available evidence through Literature Review is emphasised repeatedly in MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 and is crucial in ensuring compliance with the new &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/&quot;&gt;EU MDR&lt;/a&gt;. In this article, we discuss what you should know before undertaking medical device Literature Reviews for &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/risk-management&quot;&gt;Risk Management&lt;/a&gt; or other purposes under the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;1-start-with-research-questions&quot;&gt;1. Start with research questions&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Research questions are intended to guide search term selection, helping to frame the boundaries of the Literature Review. In short, &lt;strong&gt;research questions set out what you intend to discover from the Literature Review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 recommends using a PICO framework to help you in perfecting your research questions. PICO format is extensively employed in evidence-based clinical practice. This approach results in a “well-built” query that specifies four concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;the Patient issue or Population&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;the Intervention&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;the Comparison (if one exists)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;the Outcome(s)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you formulate your research questions, accordingly, determine the information required to answer these questions. This leads us to tip number 2.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;2-choose-your-search-terms&quot;&gt;2. Choose your search terms&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that you have the research questions and the information required to answer these queries, &lt;strong&gt;convert the questions into searchable terms&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While formulating your search terms, you can use Boolean operators such as ‘OR,’ ‘AND,’ and ‘NOT’ to tailor the results according to your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The search terms are then applied to scientific literature databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Google scholar, EMBASE and Cochrane review as sources to identify the evidence. A search in these databases can generate an overwhelmingly high number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Analysing all of them to identify the appropriate ones is going to be a ‘Herculean task’ if you don’t choose search terms carefully and have an efficient exclusion strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;3-dealing-with-exclusions&quot;&gt;3. Dealing with exclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1:&lt;/b&gt; Five common pitfalls when writing a Clinical Evaluation Report&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To separate the ‘wheat from the chaff’ and avoid the inclusion of irrelevant articles, you need a carefully configured exclusion strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An easy way to do this is to formulate an exclusion criterion table to avoid duplicate, irrelevant and weak evidence. For example, you can assign a different exclusion code for:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;duplicate articles&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;articles with inappropriate focus&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;articles which is unrelated to subject matter&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;weak evidence such as narrative reviews&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;opinion articles&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;animal studies&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With these exclusion codes in mind, you can eliminate any articles that fall under your exclusion criteria. &lt;strong&gt;However, remember to keep a record of all the excluded articles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;4-appraise-properly&quot;&gt;4. Appraise properly&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you identify the appropriate articles, you can start reviewing and appraising the clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appraisal is the process of systematically reviewing research to determine its credibility, as well as its usefulness and applicability in the context. The clinical evidence should be evaluated thoroughly and objectively, with appropriate weighting given to the positive and negative aspects of each document and to each piece of research as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to perform an effective appraisal&lt;/strong&gt; is to set out an appraisal framework to determine the methodological quality, scientific validity, relevance to the clinical evaluation and weighting to the overall clinical evaluation of each data source. It may be beneficial to assign a code to each element of appraisal along with a score for quality in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/literature-reviews&quot;&gt;Our Systematic Literature Review process&lt;/a&gt; uses a 7-domain appraisal structure covering all aspects of study design, quality and relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;5-list-out-safety--performance-benchmarks-as-you-go&quot;&gt;5. List out safety &amp;amp; performance benchmarks as you go&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The final tip for performing Literature Reviews is to identify and list out the safety and performance benchmarks in the clinical evidence which is relevant to the context.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, if you are performing a Literature Review on a medical device, then the performance and safety benchmarks directly related to the device and those related to its comparable alternatives should be recorded. &lt;strong&gt;Do this as you go along&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than ‘reverse engineering’ benchmarks at the end of the appraisal, as this will save considerable time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A specific tip is to &lt;strong&gt;copy-paste benchmarks into a separate text editor file&lt;/strong&gt; for reference later in the review process. This will help you to summarise the clinical evidence identified and to establish the state of the art in your Literature Review.&lt;/p&gt;

It calls for a comprehensive appraisal and analysis of all clinical evidence relating to the subject device, along with an objective analysis of data relating to the clinical background and comparable alternative devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-insert youtube-player&quot; data-id=&quot;iYaq1nJyW5o&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1:&lt;/b&gt; Five common pitfalls when writing a Clinical Evaluation Report&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because of the breadth of ground each CER needs to cover, they invariably become weighty documents often running to hundreds of pages. As a result, it’s very easy to become lost. It’s therefore vital to know how to structure the document and keep track of all the different sections.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are several resources available to help. Not everything out there is authoritative or reliable, so in this article we outline 5 of the most useful and trustworthy resources to use when writing a medical device CER.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;resource-1---the-mdr-itself&quot;&gt;Resource 1 - The MDR itself&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The old phrase &lt;q&gt;“talk to the organ grinder, not the monkey”&lt;/q&gt; is as applicable to medical device regulation as it is elsewhere in life. The  MDR may not be the easiest document to work with, but there’s little substitute for going directly to the legislative source for direct guidance on requirements for CERs. The most relevant sections are:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Article 61 - which sets out core rules and expectations for Clinical Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Annex XIV Part A - which provides a line-by-line top-level overview of expected contents&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it would be improper to expect detailed guidance from the MDR, the highlighted sections provide the backbone around which the other resources fit, so it’s vital to understand them. The good news is that we’ve made working with the MDR easier than ever - download our free &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-guidance-resources/white-papers&quot;&gt;Mastering the MDR&lt;/a&gt; White Paper to see what we mean.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;resource-2---meddev-271-rev-4&quot;&gt;Resource 2 - MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medical-device-regulation.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2_7_1_rev4_en.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4&lt;/a&gt; was the go-to resource for CERs under the MDD. It’s one of several official medical device guidelines produced directly by the Commission and can therefore certainly be regarded as authoritative. It’s also comprehensive and addresses many aspects of performing Clinical Evaluation in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The major drawbacks to the MedDev are that it is difficult to work with and, vitally, hasn’t yet been updated to reflect changes introduced by the MDR. As a result, it’s no longer the bulletproof resource that it used to be. It also fails to provide any guidance on the use of language and styling, meaning that it’s easy to still feel ‘out at sea’ even after reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having said all that, it continues to be a useful resource even allowing for its outdated status. While it would be a mistake to rely on MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4 in isolation, it should still be part of your CER arsenal. As to whether it’s likely to be updated any time soon - unfortunately, that remains an open question for now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;resource-3---mdcg-2020-13&quot;&gt;Resource 3 - MDCG 2020-13&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Written by the Medical Device Coordination Group, the set of MDCG Guidelines comprise a useful set of guidance that generally focus on specific aspects of medical device regulatory activities. They are useful for multiple activities including PMCF and planning and implementing clinical investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2020-07/md_2020-13-cea-report-template_en_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MDCG 2020-13&lt;/a&gt; is especially interesting since it provides a template for a Clinical Evaluation Assessment Report. In other news, it can be thought of as providing the ‘marking sheet’ that &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/notified-bodies&quot;&gt;Notified Bodies&lt;/a&gt; will use when assessing a CER. It’s a great way to validate an existing draft CER and a useful resource to incorporate into planning; accordingly, MDCG 2020-13 is a must-have resource that is free to download and relatively easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;resource-4---other-mdcg-guidelines&quot;&gt;Resource 4 - Other MDCG guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MDCG 2020-13 isn’t the only MDCG guideline that can be helpful during &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the circumstances, there are two others that are worth downloading if they are relevant to your device:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2020_6_guidance_sufficient_clinical_evidence_en_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MDCG 2020-6&lt;/a&gt; - Provides specific guidance for performing Clinical Evaluation on legacy devices - i.e. those previously CE-marked under the MDD&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2020-09/md_mdcg_2020_5_guidance_clinical_evaluation_equivalence_en_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MDCG 2020-5&lt;/a&gt; - Offers detailed guidance on making a claim of equivalence&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As with the other MDCG guidelines, these are free to download and definitely worth reading through if relevant to your device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;resource-5---cer-templates&quot;&gt;Resource 5 - CER Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-insert youtube-player&quot; data-id=&quot;cUu6YtEdO9c&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video:&lt;/b&gt; See how our Clinical Evaluation Report writing service works from start to finish&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even with all of the above resources available, writing a CER can still be a daunting prospect. Many people therefore reach for CER templates, with many of varying quality available on the internet. Beware - using the wrong template will seriously derail the Clinical Evaluation process. It’s imperative that the template will enable the production of a CER that will meet requirements, otherwise it’s a waste of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The good news is that we have made our proprietary &lt;a href=&quot;/enable-ce-mark/eu-mdr-templates-documents-tools/clinical-evaluation-report-cer-template&quot;&gt;CER Template&lt;/a&gt; available to download. This unique 64-page template offers unparalleled levels of guidance for writing CERs for any type of medical device. Fully updated to reflect all the latest requirements, our template goes way beyond any other and includes:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;line-by-line guidance on all parts of every CER section&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;illustrative examples, showing not just what to write, but how to write it&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;sections of ‘device agnostic’ text that can be transposed directly into your CER&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1:&lt;/b&gt; Five common pitfalls when writing a Clinical Evaluation Report&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it’s common to run into difficulties when writing a CER and it’s not a task to approach lightly. Because “forewarned is forearmed”, here are five common pitfalls when writing a CER and some tips to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pitfall-1---not-being-ready&quot;&gt;Pitfall 1 - Not being ready&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In some cases, manufacturers attempt to write a CER too early in a device’s developmental journey. Because a CER considers a broad range of evidence including pre-clinical bench tests, clinical evidence and PMS data, there’s little point conducting a CER until such information is available.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having said that, it is possible to use a framework CER to act as a form of enhanced Gap Analysis by highlighting aspects of a regulatory strategy that are missing; however, using a CER this way requires an experienced eye and a very thorough CER structure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt; - If you are writing it yourself, it&apos;s generally better to wait until the device is more mature before attempting a Clinical Evaluation Report.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pitfall-2---incorrect-structure&quot;&gt;Pitfall 2 - Incorrect structure&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that it’s vital to know what needs to be included in a CER. Difficulties can arise because requirements are dynamic, meaning that what constituted correct structure a year ago might not be sufficient today.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A common failure point is an over-reliance on outdated guidelines such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medical-device-regulation.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2_7_1_rev4_en.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4&lt;/a&gt; - while this was the ‘gold standard’ for many years, this has not yet been updated to reflect changes in the MDR. Furthermore, MedDev is not especially easy to work with. An optimal CER structure will account for requirements in the MDR as well as MDCG guidelines, industry standards and the aspects of MedDev that remain relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt; - Because ensuring the correct CER structure is so vital to success, we were motivated to release our unique, &lt;a href=&quot;/enable-ce-mark/eu-mdr-templates-documents-tools/clinical-evaluation-report-cer-template&quot;&gt;64-page CER Template&lt;/a&gt; which provides not only the correct structure, but also includes sample text, examples and other guidance to give you line-by-line support through the entire CER-writing process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pitfall-3---not-accounting-for-exclusions&quot;&gt;Pitfall 3 - Not accounting for exclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All good CERs require an extensive review of the medical literature. In fact, done properly, a CER actually calls for two reviews - one against the subject device itself, and another against the clinical background and any comparable alternative devices. The latter is used to determine safety and performance benchmarks against which to assess the subject device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As if performing thorough &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/systematic-literature-reviews&quot;&gt;Systematic Literature Reviews&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t enough of a challenge, it’s also a requirement that you account for and justify every excluded paper for each search term you use. Needless to say, because some search terms will generate thousands of results, this can become extremely time-consuming and laborious.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt; - It&apos;s vital that you have an effective strategy to ensure that exclusion handling is efficient and manageable, including careful search term selection and use of appropriate software.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our team have developed a range of unique techniques that enable us to offer a market-leading &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/literature-reviews&quot;&gt;literature review and exclusions service&lt;/a&gt; that is central to the way we deliver CERs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pitfall-4---incorrect-use-of-language-and-naked-opinions&quot;&gt;Pitfall 4 - Incorrect use of language and ‘naked’ opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a pitfall that even the most experienced writers can fall into.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt; - It&apos;s crucial that the correct type of language is adopted throughout the CER.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure that an objective ‘third person’ tense is used. For example, using terms such as “we feel that this constitutes an appropriate number of complaints over a 12-month period” introduces an ‘opinion’ that has no place in an objective assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, use phrasing such as &lt;i&gt;“There were x recorded complaints between December 2020 and December 2021. As presented in Section 1.2.3, this is numerically equivalent to rates seen for Products A, B and C which constitute comparable alternatives to the subject device.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Always avoid opinions - especially if they are ‘naked’ - ie unsubstantiated. So “This is the most common cause of acne” would be better phrased as “Jones et al (2017) undertook a systematic review which found that x is the most common cause of acne in adolescent males”.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pitfall-5---lack-of-objectivity&quot;&gt;Pitfall 5 - Lack of objectivity&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When writing a CER for your own product, this is perhaps the most difficult pitfall to avoid. The MDR calls for an objective approach with equal weighting (allowing for variances in study design and quality) given to sources that are favourable and unfavourable to the subject device. Presenting negative data against one’s own device is never comfortable or easy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip&lt;/b&gt; - Nonetheless, avoiding or inappropriately excluding negative data is a big no-no and will inevitably lead to a non-conformity. There&apos;s no easy fix, although it&apos;s a strong argument in favour of engaging an external specialist to help with the preparation of the CER.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the advent of the &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/&quot;&gt;EU MDR&lt;/a&gt; has changed the rules, meaning that equivalence is a more complicated option than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we give you five tips for making an equivalence claim when performing &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; under the MDR.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-1---understand-the-process&quot;&gt;Tip 1 - Understand the process&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This may sound obvious, but the first thing to do is to ensure you know exactly what equivalence is.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-insert youtube-player&quot; data-id=&quot;3EDLJ0s2b0U&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video:&lt;/b&gt; An in-depth look into medical device equivalence and its role in device approval under the MDR&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Equivalence is the process of demonstrating that two or more devices are similar to the point that there is no clinically relevant difference in their safety and clinical performance. In other words, it’s much more than just showing they are ‘similar’ — equivalent means ‘effectively the same as’, meaning that it’s harder to prove than a claim of similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we’ll discuss shortly, &lt;b&gt;an equivalence claim can only work if the subject device is shown to be clinically, technically, and biologically equivalent to another device in the market which is already CE marked&lt;/b&gt;. It won’t work if claiming equivalence to a device that is not CE-marked under the MDR - and yes, that includes devices in the UK too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-2---do-the-prep-work&quot;&gt;Tip 2 - Do the prep work&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A claim of equivalence encompasses three aspects — the technical, biological, and clinical attributes of the device. So, if you are comparing two devices that have the same features but are built of different materials, it will not make the cut. Therefore, spend some time digging into the features of the subject and equivalent device in all three domains before making a claim.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medical-device-regulation.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2_7_1_rev4_en.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MedDev 2.7/1 rev 4&lt;/a&gt;, equivalence claims should be backed up with strong scientific evidence. This may require an extensive literature search to address the device’s technical, biological, and clinical specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/medical-device-manufacturers&quot;&gt;medical device manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; should identify and declare any differences between the two devices that are revealed during the literature analysis – don’t shy away from them. Conducting a Gap Analysis to see whether there is a clinically relevant difference between your product and the proposed equivalent will also help you to flesh out the equivalence claim.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Along with this, the manufacturer may need information relating to the equivalent device that isn’t easy to obtain – which means another tip is to…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-3---get-sufficient-access&quot;&gt;Tip 3 - Get sufficient access&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the MDR, it’s necessary to show that you have sufficient access to data relating to the equivalent device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;guide-funnel medium bg-b2 bg-dark&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evaluation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Clinical Evaluation&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Consulting Services&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CERs, CEPs, literature reviews &amp;amp; data analysis for all classes of medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evaluation&quot; class=&quot;button secondary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon-angle-right after&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learn more &lt;span&gt;about our Clinical Evaluation services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For class III devices, this requirement extends all the way to having a contract in place with the manufacturer of the equivalent device granting full access to technical files. Given that the equivalent device will often be made by a competitor, this all but rules out equivalence for many Class III devices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While ‘sufficient access’ isn’t defined in detail for other classes of device, there are several principles to hold in mind. It’s worth phrasing the sufficient access statement around areas of uncertainty – so, for example, if it’s easily demonstrable from publicly-available information that two devices are technically equivalent, state that the ‘key data’ that must be accessed relates to biological and clinical characteristics. This helps narrow the scrutiny of the reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this may enable the performance of tests or direct experience with the device to meet the sufficiency test. Ultimately, meeting the access test comes down to a judgement call but it doesn’t always mean raiding a competitor’s technical files. With the exception of Class III devices, it’s about forming a reasoned argument and amassing as much information as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-4---go-three-dimensional&quot;&gt;Tip 4: - Go three dimensional&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The three dimensions to be taken into consideration while demonstrating equivalence are technical, biological, and clinical characteristics of the devices. Having done the prep work, it’s time to form the argument. Here’s the low down on each aspect of equivalence:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;technical&quot;&gt;Technical&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technical equivalency means that the device is of similar design; it is used under similar conditions; it has similar specifications and properties, including physicochemical properties; it employs similar deployment methods, where applicable; and it has similar operating principles and critical performance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;biological&quot;&gt;Biological&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The device employs the same materials or substances in touch with the same human tissues or body fluids for similar types and durations of contact, as well as similar substance release characteristics, such as degradation products and leachables.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;clinical&quot;&gt;Clinical&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clinical equivalency can be claimed only if the device is used for the same clinical condition including similar severity and stage of disease, at the same site in the body, in a similar population, including age, anatomy, and physiology; device has the same type of user; and has comparable relevant critical performance considering the expected clinical effect for a specific intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;tip-5---get-the-message-across&quot;&gt;Tip 5 - Get the message across&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having done all this work, don’t let your claim fail because it isn’t set out in a way that appeals to the reviewer. The most effective way to display the analysis and comparison of data is to prepare a set of tables comparing the devices’ technical, biological, and clinical properties, along with a column on the effects on any differences on clinical safety and performance. This forensic, line-by-line approach enables the reviewer to follow the argument as it builds. Any identified differences and their implications for safety and performance should be carefully justified in a paragraph following the tables.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;So much of working with the &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/&quot;&gt;EU MDR&lt;/a&gt; concerns the harvesting, identification, appraisal and analysis of clinical evidence that, in the absence of effective data collection systems, the whole framework can become inefficient with ongoing regulatory approval becoming highly problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-clinical-follow-up-pmcf&quot;&gt;Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/vigilance&quot;&gt;Vigilance systems&lt;/a&gt; are vital components of &lt;a href=&quot;/eu-mdr-compliance/post-market-surveillance-pms&quot;&gt;Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) systems&lt;/a&gt; under the EU MDR. In this article, we consider steps that manufacturers can take to drive compliance with PMCF and vigilance data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The following ‘golden rules’ guide all of our PMCF design services and underpin our success in driving ongoing investigator engagement and data collection compliance. For further information about our approach to maximising data collection compliance, read about &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evidence-generation&quot;&gt;our PMCF services&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;speak with a member of our team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-data-collection---the-golden-rules&quot;&gt;Effective data collection - the golden rules&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whatever the type of clinical data being collected - whether it’s PMCF data, complaints, or inputs into a formal clinical trial - there are several ‘golden rules’ that help maximise data collection compliance. In turn, adherence to these rules can help ensure that you have access to the clinical evidence you need for ongoing approval of your device.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;1-keep-it-simple&quot;&gt;1. Keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important of all of the golden rules, it’s vital to keep datapoints simple and streamlined. It’s so tempting to add more and more datapoints, reasoning that the study will have more ‘value’ if questions are granular and detailed. In reality, time-consuming data entry forms are the quickest way to reduce data entry compliance and the worst way to encourage investigators to continue engaging with the study.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule 1&lt;/b&gt; - Data points should be reduced to the minimum required to fulfil the objectives of the study. Questions should be simple to understand, unambiguous, and quick to answer. Unnecessary detail should be entirely eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;2-make-data-entry-easy-and-convenient&quot;&gt;2. Make data entry easy and convenient&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Too many manufacturers rely on cumbersome, paper-based data collection systems. Paper based data entry suffers from numerous flaws that, in turn, will lead to patchy data collection. These flaws include:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Paper can get lost or damaged and can easily fall into the wrong hands.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Paper is slow to work with and must eventually be transcribed into a digital format for analysis, introducing a source of error or bias.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Paper must either be physically transported from the clinical site to the study sponsor (or nominee) or digitally transcribed on-site, introducing a further reason for poor investigator compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-designed digital data collection platforms overcome all of these problems&lt;/strong&gt; and introduce a level of data security that is impossible to achieve with manual systems.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule 2&lt;/b&gt; - Data collection should be through dedicated digital systems that are designed specifically for handling clinical data. They should be incredibly simple to use and should function from smartphone, tablet or computer. They should have low data and processor requirements and should not lag or fail. Digital data storage should adhere to the highest recognised standards relating to the handling and storage of clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;3-reward-and-support-investigators&quot;&gt;3. Reward and support investigators&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clinical investigators are busy people. The truth is that every time a clinician or user enters data relating to your device, your are indebted to them for their efforts. Too many manufacturers begin to take investigators for granted; especially (and somewhat counter-intuitively) those who are the most prolific data enterers. This stems from the idea that compliant investigators will ‘take care of themselves’ and that efforts should focus on those who are proving troublesome to get up and running with the study. This is the wrong approach. In reality, &lt;strong&gt;80% of your data will likely come from 20% of your investigators&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is these who should be thanked, rewarded (compliantly) and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule 3&lt;/b&gt; - Focus on your best investigators and ensure they know that their efforts are appreciated. Do everything you can (compliantly) to demonstrate your ongoing gratitude for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;4-ensure-that-follow-up-requirements-are-reasonable&quot;&gt;4. Ensure that follow-up requirements are reasonable&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When designing clinical studies, it is tempting to plan for long-term follow-up of subjects that far exceeds that normally encountered in clinical practice. The allure of this is easy to understand - outcomes at ten years post intervention can generally be held to be more definitive than those at six months.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, long-term follow-up requirements are a sure-fire way to find compliance with data entry waning over time. Before you know it, your ten-year follow-up study could have only a small percentage of investigators and subjects still participating in the study only a proportion of the way through its planned duration. While a reasonable middle ground will usually need to be found, &lt;strong&gt;it’s much better to have high compliance to a shorter follow-up than poor compliance to a longer one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;notice info&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rule 4&lt;/b&gt; - Ensure that follow-up periods are sensible, appropriate and easy for investigators and subjects to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;video-wrap&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;video-insert youtube-player&quot; data-id=&quot;tCVN95NoArI&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video:&lt;/b&gt; How to build an EU MDR-compliant regulatory system for your medical devices&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our experience working with clients across the industry has shown that many companies seek to save money by using purely retrospective data for PMCF submissions, or attempt to justify non-performance of PMCF when they should, in reality, have a system in place.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this article, we move away from the purely regulatory benefits of engaging fully with PMCF and consider the wider benefits of a &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evidence-generation&quot;&gt;well-designed PMCF system&lt;/a&gt; to your business, your products and your relationship with your clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pmcf-benefits-your-business&quot;&gt;PMCF benefits your business&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Generating clinical data is expensive. Prospective studies, in particular, can pose significant resource challenges because, by definition, they run for months or years at a time, consuming resources as they do so. The allure of using retrospective data for PMCF is therefore easy to understand from a business planning perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, consider the requirements for PMCF in Annex XIV Part B of the EU MDR. The Annex calls for &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt; data collection &lt;strong&gt;throughout the entire commercial lifetime of a device&lt;/strong&gt;. In practical terms, achieving the latter criterion will be almost impossible with retrospective data; it would require repeated studies over time with one following immediately upon another. This, in turn, would require repeated investment, time, resource, approvals, documentation, statistical analysis and reporting. While using retrospective data may be attractive in the short term, in reality it may simply be compounding problems for the business’ future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A better approach would be a single investment in a well-designed and future-proofed dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;/medical-device-regulatory-consulting-services/clinical-evidence-generation&quot;&gt;prospective PMCF study&lt;/a&gt;. Once set up, this single system could collect data on the safety and performance of a medical device or product family indefinitely, fulfilling the Annex XIV criteria in a single swoop. This would also prevent the need for constant updating of documents and repeated passage through study approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From a business perspective, it becomes easier to estimate resource requirements into the future with less duplication and wastage of time and money.
        Investing in a good-quality PMCF system for your devices can help safeguard both their regulatory approvals and your business over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;pmcf-engages-your-customers&quot;&gt;PMCF engages your customers&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A further benefit provided by any well-designed PMCF system is the opportunity it provides for a further source of engagement with your customers. A change of emphasis from a “box ticking data collection exercise” to an opportunity to work collaboratively in promoting device safety is only one aspect of how PMCF can bring you and your customers closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In particular, medical device PMCF registries call for close co-operation between customers (investigators) and manufacturer. Initial conversations about study participation, on-boarding processes, compliant remuneration frameworks, collating data and overcoming study-related challenges all provide important touch-points between manufacturer and customer, strengthening the sense of familiarity and co-operative working.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the act of selecting a clinical site may help them to feel valued and appreciated, cementing a positive relationship and, in turn, perception of your products and you as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Customer relationships must be handled sensitively in relation to all forms of clinical study and PMCF is no exception. In particular, study participation must in no way act as an inducement to buy or use the product. And, as with all clinical studies, challenges will arise from time-to-time that may strain relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, the right approach from the outset can more than overcome any such challenges and companies that build a network of satisfied customers actively engaging in their PMCF activities stand to secure both their customer relations and their regulatory approval both now and well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
